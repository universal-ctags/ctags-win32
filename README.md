# Universal Ctags Win32/64 daily builds

This project provides daily builds of [universal-ctags](https://ctags.io) for Win32/64.

You can download the zip packages from the [releases](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags-win32/releases) page.

Four types of packages are provided:

* `ctags-{ctagsver}-x64.zip`: x64 package
* `ctags-{ctagsver}-x64.debuginfo.zip`: x64 debug symbol files
* `ctags-{ctagsver}-x86.zip`: x86 package
* `ctags-{ctagsver}-x86.debuginfo.zip`: x86 debug symbol files

`{ctagsver}` can be an exact tag name of the [ctags repository](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) (when the latest commit is tagged) or a generated name in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD_{tag}-N-gHHHHHHHH` (when the latest commit is not tagged).

x64/x86 package includes stripped binaries. If you want to debug the binaries on GDB, extract the package and the debug symbol files into the same directory, and also put the ctags source code there.

There are also experimental packages that are built with Clang and linked against Universal CRT:

* `ctags-{ctagsver}-clang-x64.zip`: x64 package built with Clang
* `ctags-{ctagsver}-clang-x64.debuginfo.zip`: clang-x64 debug symbol files

Hopefully, the issue reported at [#3014](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/issues/3014) is solved.

# Note

Starting from the build [2017-10-14/d9944ef9](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags-win32/releases/tag/2017-10-14%2Fd9944ef9), Universal Ctags doesn't load `~/.ctags` and other exuberant-ctags compatible configuration files.
See `man/ctags.1.html` and `man/ctags-incompatibilities.7.html` in the zip packages. Also refer to [#1519](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/pull/1519).

Starting from the build [2019-10-03/70b44e7d](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags-win32/releases/tag/2019-10-03%2F70b44e7d), the default directory separator has been changed from `\\` to `/`. This should improve the compatibilities to Exuberant Ctags, however if you still have a compatibility issue, try `--output-format=e-ctags` option. Also refer to [#2199](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/pull/2199) and [#1325](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/issues/1325).

Starting from the build [2019-12-10/9f494f08](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags-win32/releases/tag/2019-12-10%2F9f494f08), Universal Ctags uses [the UTF-8 code page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/design/globalizing/use-utf8-code-page) on Windows 10 version 1903 or later. This allows you to use Unicode file names on u-ctags. Also refer to [#2360](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/pull/2360) and [#1837](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags/issues/1837).
